    # Actually open total would also be 24500+1000 = 25500 > 20000 → open-total fails FIRST.
    # To isolate ticker check, we need open total under cap.
    # Use account_value=200k: open cap = $40k. XLE existing $24.5k.
    # ticker cap = 25% × $200k = $50k. Existing $24.5k + proposed $26k = $50.5k > $50k → ticker fails.
    # But per_trade cap = 5% × $200k = $10k. Proposed $26k > $10k → per-trade fails FIRST.
    # Pure ticker-cap test needs proposed under per-trade AND open-total but pushing ticker over.
    # account=$1000k. per_trade cap=$50k. ticker cap=$250k. existing XLE=$249k. proposed $50k → ticker total $299k > $250k.
    # open cap = $200k. existing total = $249k > open cap ALREADY. Hmm.
    # Realistic test: account=$200k, existing XLE=$49k (just under per-ticker cap), proposed $2k (under per-trade $10k).
    # existing+proposed = $51k > ticker cap $50k → ticker fail.
    # But open total = $49k + $2k = $51k. open cap = $40k. open-total fails first. Damn.
    # Try: open is fine, ticker fails:
    # account=$400k. per_trade cap=$20k. open cap=$80k. ticker cap=$100k.
    # existing XLE=$99k. existing total=$99k (XLE only). + proposed $2k = open $101k > $80k → open fails first.
    # Conclusion: ticker cap (25%) always > open cap (20%), so per-ticker check only matters when
    # there are MULTIPLE tickers. Let me construct: open is fine across distinct tickers, but adding to existing
    # ticker pushes that one over its individual 25% cap.
    # account=$100k. per_trade=$5k. open=$20k. ticker=$25k. Existing: just XLE=$23k. Open total = $23k > $20k already.
    # Hmm, can't have a single ticker exceed open total cap without open failing.
    # The ticker cap matters only relative to a single SYMBOL within the open total.
    # If existing XLE=$10k and existing SPY=$8k, open=$18k. Then proposed XLE $4k:
    # per_trade $4k OK (<$5k). open $22k > $20k → open fails. Still ticker isn't isolated.
    # Realistically the ticker check is a tighter constraint than open-total only when proposed adds
    # to one existing ticker more than 25%. In normal flow open will block first.
    # So this test verifies the check WORKS (returns ticker failure when relevant), even if rare.
    # Construct: existing XLE=$24k (under 25% cap), open=$24k (over 20%... no).
    # OK realistic: account=$100k. open cap=$20k. ticker cap=$25k. existing XLE=$15k. proposed XLE $3k.
    # per_trade $3k < $5k OK. open $18k < $20k OK. ticker $18k < $25k OK. → ok!
    # To force ticker fail isolated: existing XLE=$24.5k. open total = $24.5k > $20k cap → open fails.
    # So ticker check is genuinely the LAST line — it triggers only when existing+proposed for ONE symbol
    # exceeds 25% while open total is somehow within 20%. Mathematically impossible unless caps are tweaked.
    # The check is defensive (e.g., for a future config where ticker cap < open cap), not currently
    # reachable with defaults. Test with non-default caps:
