## Tactical Markets (In Planning, Hopper Until Market Stress Dashboard Ships)

**Two companion tool briefs drafted and committed (2026-04-27):**
- `tactical_markets/ROADMAP_SIGNAL_GENERATION.md` — overnight repricing + sector rotation dashboard (6:30 AM premarket signals)
- `tactical_markets_trading/ROADMAP_ALPACA_INTEGRATION.md` — Alpaca paper trading integration + validation loop (Phase 1–3)
- `tactical_markets/RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md` — research grounding (2000–2026 empirical findings)

**Status:** Specs locked in, research-backed, not yet coded. Remain in hopper until Market Stress Dashboard is complete and all Phase G items shipped. Target start: after 2026-05-30 regime-weights review checkpoint.

## Sonnet's next execution queue

Ordered top-down by value × (1/effort), respecting dependencies. Sonnet should
execute in order. Design-first items marked 🅾️ — route through Opus before
Sonnet starts.

### Phase 0 — Highest priority (do these first)

- [ ] 🅾️ **Codebase optimization pass** — Opus reviews all source files for superfluous code, rough edges between modules, and efficiency improvements. Produces a prioritised list; Sonnet executes.

- [ ] **Model explainer section in backtest report** *(Sonnet-executable once content is drafted)*
  Add a collapsible or tabbed section to `output/backtest_report.html` that explains the model two ways:
  (1) **Expert view** — statistical methodology: percentile scoring, Spearman IC, bucket weighting, regime classification, backtest design, known limitations (look-ahead, survivorship, data gaps).
  (2) **Plain-English view** — for someone with no stats/finance/econ background: what the score means, what each bucket is watching for, how to read the bands, what the model can and can't predict, when to act on it vs ignore it.
  Both views should be accessible from the main dashboard via the existing "View full backtest report →" link.

### Phase A — Verify & clean (30–60 min)

- [x] **Verification sweep** — all shipped briefs confirmed rendering: event overlay, correlation card, staleness, audit log, provenance (weights_hash populated; code_sha empty as expected — primary dir has no git). Pruning archive absent but OK (25 rows, < 2yr). No gaps found.
- [x] **Delete `config/weights.yaml.bak`** — done (was never in git; only existed in primary dir).

### Phase B — Dashboard UX (1–2 days of high-leverage polish)

Grouped into batches so the same HTML / config file is only touched once per batch.

- [x] **UX Batch A — Layout & explainer captions** *(commit cfe6101)*
  All 6 items shipped: explainer on REVIEW PROMPTS, side-by-side action cards, correlation caption, trend subtitle + band key, calendar indicator badges, composite leads page with narrative moved below action cards.

- [x] **UX Batch B — Weight display & bar chart** *(commit da9ba03)*
  All 3 items shipped: bucket header shows "X% of composite", each indicator row shows "X% of bucket · Y% of composite", compact 5px flex bar chart under each bucket title. All weights pulled live from weights.yaml.

- [x] **Brief 4B — Indicator drill-down pages** *(already shipped — src/indicator_detail.py)*
  Per-indicator `<details>` block with 10yr SVG chart + stats (min/max/median/percentile/current/last-obs). Wired into dashboard.py, links from indicator labels in bucket table.

- [x] **UX Batch C — Full tooltip coverage** *(effectively shipped + regime_adjusted added)*
  All 26 indicators, 11 buckets, composite, bands, correlation, shock_type, regime_window all have tooltips in config/tooltips.yaml and are rendered. Added regime_adjusted key (was referenced in code but missing from YAML).

### Phase C — Remaining brief work

- [x] **Brief 8 (second half) — Deescalation alerts** — already shipped
  Section 1b in `send_alerts()` fires `composite_improvement` alert with same debounce buffer when band order drops. Tested in `tests/test_alert_controls.py` (de-escalation tests at lines 68–72).

### Phase D — System resilience hardening (high-priority, Sonnet execution)

**Before adding new features, harden the existing system against silent failures and data drift.**

- [x] **Dashboard self-diagnostics** *(shipped)*
  JS `automation-banner` div injected with ISO timestamp on `<body data-run-ts="...">`. If >30 hours since last run, injects red "AUTOMATION OFFLINE — X hours ago" banner. No-op when automation is healthy.

- [x] **Brief 15 data alignment checks** *(shipped — commit e6ac3fa)*
  Signal quality card now shows backtest and composite timestamps side-by-side. Warns (yellow) if >2h apart or backtest CSV >2 days stale.

- [x] **Data quality monitoring / bucket health** *(shipped)*
  `_build_bucket_health_card()` in `dashboard.py`: collapsible "DATA QUALITY (N issues)" section. Detects (a) indicators with `percentile=None` (failed fetches falling back to 50.0) and (b) bucket scores unchanged for ≥3 consecutive runs (possible stale source). Rendered between staleness banner and composite card.

- [x] **Alert channel redundancy** *(shipped)*
  `_send_email_fallback()` in `src/alerts.py` using `smtplib` + Gmail SMTP (port 587). Triggered when both Pushover and Twilio return False. Requires `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` in `.env`; `ALERT_EMAIL_FROM`/`ALERT_EMAIL_TO` default to rekward01@gmail.com. Wire `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` in `.env` to activate.

- [x] **Mobile / responsive design** *(shipped)*
  Added `@media(max-width:600px)` block: `.hdr` stacks vertically, `.composite` stacks, `.bucket-grid` goes single-column, tooltips right-align to avoid overflow. Action row gets `flex-wrap:wrap;min-width:260px` so cards stack below ~534px.

### Phase E — Design-first items (route through Opus before Sonnet executes) 🅾️

- [x] **Brief 15 — Backtest signal-quality card + link** *(shipped)*
  Opus design pass done (2026-04-24). Scope locked: ONE compact card (rolling composite IC + recent alert hit rate + verdict) on main dashboard, plus a prominent link to the existing full `output/backtest_report.html`.

- [x] **Brief 16 — VIX term-structure indicator** *(shipped — commit e032f70)*
  VIX/VIX3M ratio in equity_volatility bucket. Reweighted: vix→0.50, vix_term_structure→0.25, sp500_1m_vol→0.25. Thresholds: yellow=0.95, orange=1.00, red=1.05. 4 new tests, 187/187 passing.

- [x] **Brief 10A — Regime classification telemetry** *(shipped — commit 9541963)*
  classify_vix_regime() in history.py; badge in composite card (low=green, mid=yellow, high=orange); regime column in history.csv; regime_previous persisted via alert_state.json. Composite unchanged. 3 new tests, 190/190 passing.

- [x] **Brief 10B — Backtest + recalibrate regime extension** *(shipped — commit 7a9108e)*
  Backtest writes `regime` column per date (point-in-time VIX tercile). evaluation.py gains per_regime_bucket_ic(). recalibrate --regime prints proposed regime_weights: YAML block to stdout (no file writes). 2 new tests, 192/192 passing.

- [x] **Brief 10C — Apply regime weights at score time** *(shipped — commit pending)*
  regime_weights: block in weights.yaml (Option A conservative multipliers, enabled=false). _apply_regime_weights() in scoring.py: computes both composite_naive and composite_regime_weighted every run. Dashboard shows "Regime preview: XX (disabled)" side-by-side with composite. Flip enabled: true after review. 3 new tests, 195/195 passing.

- [ ] **Brief 19 — Commodities & Energy bucket diversification** *(design locked 2026-04-27, ready for Sonnet)*
  Full brief in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md#brief-19--commodities--energy-bucket-diversification).
  Drops `oil_vol` (redundant with VIX/MOVE in real stress); adds `crack_spread_321`
  (3-2-1 crack — paper-vs-physical refining-margin signal, Ian's specific ask),
  `natgas` (NG=F YoY — independent supply-shock vector), and `copper_gold_ratio`
  (HG=F/GC=F — growth/risk-off proxy). New weights: wti_crude 0.30,
  crack_spread_321 0.25, natgas 0.25, copper_gold_ratio 0.20. Bucket weight in
  composite stays 0.07. Two new computed handlers, one yfinance ticker with
  yoy_series transform, three new threshold blocks, three new tooltips, three
  new tests. Bucket label stays "Commodities & Energy".

- [ ] **Regime-weights review checkpoint** *(due 2026-05-30)*
  Run `python -m src.recalibrate --regime` and check history.csv for regime distribution and composite vs composite_naive divergence. Decision criteria: (a) at least one high-regime episode where composite_regime > composite_naive and divergence made sense, (b) IC table still shows rates_curve and inflation positive in high regime, (c) no frequent regime flapping. If criteria met, flip `regime_weights.enabled: true` in config/weights.yaml and tell Sonnet to commit.

### Phase F — Blocked on Ian's scope call (do not start until Ian answers)

- [ ] 🅾️ **Paywalled news sources** *(user scope call required)*
  Which of WSJ / FT / Bloomberg does Ian actually want? What's the minimum-viable integration (RSS where allowed, archive links, nothing questionable)? Legal / ToS review required before any scraping. Not an Opus or Sonnet task until Ian picks the feeds.

- [ ] **Portfolio integration** *(user scope call required)*
  Fidelity API or CSV of position holdings for personalized recommendations. Ian needs to decide: (a) Fidelity API vs CSV input, (b) fields needed (symbol, quantity, cost basis?), (c) position-level alerts vs high-level commentary. Not an Opus or Sonnet task until Ian answers these.

### Phase G — User-requested UX additions (2026-04-25)

Ian's batch from 2026-04-25 review. Item 1 is its own brief (real behavior change);
items 2/3/7 cluster naturally as a "naming + plain-English layer" batch; items 4/5
are small ordering/link fixes; item 6 is a content-authoring brief. Sonnet should
preserve Ian's numbering when committing so the trail back to this list is clear.

- [x] **G1 — Stale data + data quality auto-remediation** *(Brief 17 v2 in ROADMAP.md — design locked, ready for Sonnet)* *(commit 13a9beb)*
  Full brief in ROADMAP.md. **Read v2 only — v1 had three load-bearing errors
  (wrong function name, unsafe pipeline placement, dispatch in wrong layer)
  that Opus corrected in v2.** Summary: after `annotate_results()` and
  *before* `log_run()`/`send_alerts()`, collect indicators with `percentile:
  None` or in `stale_indicators` (excluding `computed` types); pass
  `_remediation_keys` through `env`; the bypass dispatch lives in
  `_fetch_indicator()`, not the leaf fetch functions. Run
  `compute_composite` + `annotate_results` a second time (once max). Log
  each attempt to `data/alert_log.jsonl`. 3 new tests + 2 regression checks
  (single history row, single alert call).

- [x] **G2 — Name "Weighted Average" section + plain-English explainer** *(commit 46dc1b5)*
  Identify the section Ian is referring to (likely the composite card showing
  the 0–100 score, or the per-bucket weighted contribution row).
  - Give it an explicit heading (e.g. "COMPOSITE — WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF 11 BUCKETS").
  - Add a "What does this mean?" `<details>` block: what 0–100 represents,
    how to read the current band, what to do (or not do) with the number.
    Calibrate to Ian's stated use — "help me think, never tell me what to do."

- [ ] **G3 — Plain-English toggle on the AI narrative / summary**
  Identify the section (likely the Haiku-generated narrative paragraph).
  - Give it an explicit heading.
  - Add a toggle that flips between current text and a simpler layman version
    ("what is happening, why it matters, what a non-pro should do with it").
  - Source of layman text: ask Haiku for **both registers in one call** so
    they stay paired and we pay one round-trip. Cache to disk like other
    Haiku output.

- [ ] **G4 — Reorder: swap Overnight News Brief ↔ Historical Analogies**
  In `dashboard.py`, swap render order of these two sections. Verify with
  `python run_dashboard.py --no-cache --no-alerts --quiet` that section order
  is correct and layout doesn't break.

- [ ] **G5 — Restore clickable links in Overnight News Brief**
  Ian recalls headlines were clickable previously. Verify in `dashboard.py`
  / `news.py` whether headlines are wrapped in `<a href>`. If not clickable:
  (a) confirm the RSS feed exposes URLs, (b) thread URL through to rendered
  HTML. If clickable but not visibly so: add styling (underline + hover).

- [ ] **G6 — Indicator Detail enrichment: advanced + layman interpretations** *(Brief 18)*
  In `src/indicator_detail.py`, each indicator's `<details>` block currently
  shows chart + stats. Add two prose sub-sections per indicator:
  (a) **Advanced** — what it measures, what regimes it discriminates, known
      failure modes / lead-lag relationships.
  (b) **Plain-English** — what is this number, why it matters, how to think
      about it relative to the composite.
  Plus a "How this fits the model" line — bucket, weight, co-moving indicators.
  - Source: hand-authored YAML at `config/indicator_explainers.yaml`
    (deterministic, reviewable, no API spend per run). Schema:
    `<key>: { advanced: "...", layman: "...", model_role: "..." }`.
  - Validate at startup: every indicator in `weights.yaml` has an entry
    (or warn with a placeholder).

- [ ] **G7 — Name the buckets section**
  The container section housing Equity Volatility, Credit Spreads, Rates &
  Yield Curve, etc. has no top-level heading (or only a generic one). Add an
  explicit heading — e.g. "BUCKETS — 11 SIGNAL CATEGORIES" — matched to the
  typographic weight of other section headers (REVIEW PROMPTS, etc.).

## Status as of 2026-04-24 (post-Sonnet 4.6 execution pass)

Phases A, B, and C are fully complete. All items either shipped or confirmed
already-shipped during this session. **Phase D (resilience hardening) is now the
priority before new features.** Phase D items are Sonnet-executable (no design pass needed).
Phase E (VIX term structure, Brief 15, Brief 10, news sources) remains design-first
and requires Opus passes before Sonnet executes.

---

## Design questions pending Opus input

**Energy/Commodities bucket — paper vs. real prices** *(flagged 2026-04-27, resolved 2026-04-27)*
~~Original ask: should bucket include spot gasoline/diesel/jet fuel?~~
**Resolved as Brief 19** in ROADMAP.md. Crack spread (3-2-1) captures Ian's
paper-vs-physical intuition more cleanly than retail spot prices, and the
bucket is simultaneously diversified beyond pure WTI exposure (added natgas,
copper/gold). Real-economy "consumer energy burden" deferred to a future
non-scored display panel. See Phase E for the executable brief.

---

## Execution priorities — 2026-04-25

**Next up for Sonnet:** Phase G items G3–G7 (dashboard UX additions).
When a design question blocks progress, flag to Opus (e.g., Energy/Commodities bucket above).
